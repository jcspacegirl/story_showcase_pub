                        As Benny begins to rot, he notices a stinky smell. 'Yuck! I don't feel well,' Benny says. He remembers someone telling him that this smell is called methane. 'Methane,' he thinks, 'is a type of gas that can make our Earth too warm.' Benny feels sad because he wants to be helpful, not harmful. He dreams of being part of something wonderful instead, like a yummy snack or helping flowers grow in a beautiful garden.

                    <p>
                        Benny learns about composting, a special way to recycle old food. Instead of throwing food like banana peels into the trash, you can put them in a compost bin. Over time, these food scraps turn into super soil that helps plants grow big and strong. Benny imagines becoming part of a beautiful garden, turning into healthy soil that feeds flowers and vegetables. He feels happy knowing he can help the Earth by being part of a garden, helping plants grow without hurting the planet.

                        Years later, Lily notices more changes around her. Summers feel hotter, and winters seem colder. The gardens aren’t as bright with flowers, and there are fewer animals playing outside. People talk about not having enough water, and farmers are sad because their plants don’t grow well. Lily remembers Benny and feels sorry, thinking about how every little bit of food we waste can make these problems bigger.

From now on, Lily thinks of Benny every time she packs her lunch, making sure to eat all her food or find it a new purpose.
